<p>It is different from deleting files or folders from a disk when you want to <a href="http://www.icare-recovery.com/windows-7-recovery/windows-7-deleted-partition-recovery.html">delete the partition in Windows 7</a>, because you cannot simply delete a partition by right clicking the partition. You need to go to "Disk Management" and right click the partition, and then select "Delete" option to delete a partition. It sounds a little ridiculous if somebody deletes a partition due to mistake, but such kind of thing happens to somebody. Anyway, when a partition is deleted due to mistake, the files stored on the partition will also be deleted. Now, if you want to <a href="http://www.icare-recovery.com/howto/deleted-partition-recovery.html">restore the deleted partition</a> with its data back, iCare Data Recovery is the best choice.</p>

<p>Computer virus often has serious influence on your computer, which may destroy or corrupt the data store on your computer. Even worse, it may cause partition loss. When a partition got lost due to virus infection, you cannot restore the lost partition simply by removing the virus with help of anti-virus software. You need to rely on partition recovery software like iCare Data Recovery to get back the lost files from lost partition. However, the recovered files might be still inaccessible or corrupted because virus has destroyed them.</p>

<p>Do you find that one partition or several partitions got lost after reinstalling operating system? Usually, when we open "My Computer" and all partitions will show there. However, when we find some partitions just disappeared in "My Computer", we may think that the partitions got lost. If you also encounter such a situation, the first thing you need to do is to open "Disk Management". You may find an unallocated volume there. If so, you can assign a drive letter to this partition to see what will happen next. If you cannot find an unallocated volume in "Disk Management", you may need to find some other solution to get back the lost partitions. Whatever, if you donâ€™t want to lose data stored on the lost partitions, you may run iCare Data Recovery to perform lost partition recovery first off all before you do anything else.</p>
