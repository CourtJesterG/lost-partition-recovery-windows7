You need to go to \"Disk Management\" and right click the partition, and then select \"Delete\" option to delete a partition. It sounds a little ridiculous if somebody deletes a partition due to mistake, but such kind of thing happens to somebody. Anyway, when a partition is deleted due to mistake, the files stored on the partition will also be deleted.

You need to rely on partition recovery software like iCare Data Recovery to get back the lost files from lost partition. However, the recovered files might be still inaccessible or corrupted because virus has destroyed them.\r\n\r\n### Partition Missing after Reinstalling System\r\nDo you find that one partition or several partitions got lost after reinstalling operating system? Usually, when we open \"My Computer\" and all partitions will show there. However, when we find some partitions just disappeared in \"My Computer\", we may think that the partitions got lost. If you also encounter such a situation, the first thing you need to do is to open \"Disk Management\". You may find an unallocated volume there. If so, you can assign a drive letter to this partition to see what will happen next. If you cannot find an unallocated volume in \"Disk Management\", you may need to find some other solution to get back the lost partitions.
